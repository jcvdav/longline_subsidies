## Agenda

-   Motivation & Goals
-   What are fuel subsidies?
-   Previous work
-   Relevant policy reform
-   Methods
-   Results & discussion

## Motivation

-   More than 35% of global fish stocks are being overfished
-   Subsidies that encourage overfishing are a key driver of overcapacity in the fishing industry
-   Subsidization is economicaly inefficient

## Goals

-   Understand how fishing behavior changes in response to policy
-   Provide a reference for actions that decrease fishing effort

## Fuel subsidies

**What are fuel subsidies?**

-   Capacity-enhancing subsidies that directly incentivize increased effort
-   Financial contributions awarded from the government on fuel that can partially determine profitability


. . .

**Why should we care?**

-   Subsidies increase fishing effort, leading to over 60% of Mexican fishery stocks being at unsustainable levels
-   Many fisheries are not profitable without subsidies

## Previous Work

-   Revollo-Fernández et al. (2024) estimated economic and marginal product value to establish a direct relationship between subsidies and extraction
-   Sumaila et al. (2019) establishes the bulk of global subsidies to still be within the category of “capacity-enhancing” subsidies

## Relevant Policy Reform

<!-- ![World Trade Organization Sustainable Development Goals](plots/sdg_txt.png) -->

## *Impromptu* Mexican subsidy reform

-   Mexico provided fuel subsidies to its fisheries since 2006
-   In 2020, it eliminated fuel subsidies for the fishing sector
-   The vessels referenced in this study recieved an average of **\$40,000 USD** in subsidies annually prior to reform

. . .

**Specific Objectives**

-   Understand how Mexico’s subsidy reform has caused a shift in effort, landings, and catch-per-unit-effort
-   Focus: tuna longline fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, heavily subsidized prior to 2020

## Data sources

**Subsidy data**

-   CausaNautra provides subsidy allocations by economic unit from 2011-2019
-   Allows us to identify who received a subsidy before the reform

. . .

**Vessel Montioring System**

-   From Mexico's Satelite Monitoring of Fishing Vessels System
-   provides vessel location, identity, and time
-   2007 - present

. . .

**Vessel-level landings**

-   From National Commission of Aquaculture and Fisheries (CONAPESCA)
-   Target species and annual weight of live catch (kg)
-   2000-present

## Vessel status data

-   Mexican vessel registry including vessel characteristics, gear type, and home port

# Methods

## Focus Area

![Ramírez‑Mendoza et al.](plots/longline_sets.png)

## Data processing

-   VMS filtering
    -   26 longline vessels (81.3% of total fleet)
    -   2016-2024
    -   Depth \> 50m, Distance from shore \> 500m
-   Merged with subsidy and landings data
-   Calculated annual effort (hours), total catch (kg) and catch-per-unit-effort (kg/hr) by vessel

## Data analysis

$$
y_{it} = \beta S_{it} + \omega_i + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

-   $y_{it}$: Outcome variable for vessel $i$ at year $t$
-   $S_{it}$: Variable for subsidy period (0 = pre reform, 1 = post reform)
-   $\omega_i$: Fixed effect for vessel $i$
-   $\varepsilon_{it}$: Error term
-   $\beta$: Effect of subsidy reform on outcome variable

## Data analysis

<!-- I suggest you remove this slide alltogether to save some time-->

-   We used a linear regression model to analyze the differences in effort, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort before and after subsidy reform

-   This allows for an understanding of vessel-level differences in fishing behavior and productivity

: Impact of Subsidy Reform on effort, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort (cpue)

<!-- 1361 / 5079 = 0.26 -->

- 26% decrease in effort
- 16% decrease in catch
- 20% **increase** in catch-per-unit-effort


## Discussion

-   Fuel-subsidy removal can substantially curb fishing effort and reduce total catch

-   Efficiency of the fishery increases when marginal vessels are no longer subsidized

-   First vessel-level estimates of the consequences of capacity-reducing reforms in the Gulf of Mexico tuna longline fishery

-   Long-term impacts of reforms require further investigation to ensure sustainable fisheries management

. . .

**Next steps**

-   Compare patterns of behavior to an unsubsidized fleet as a control group
