## Agenda

-   Motivation & Goals
-   What are fuel subsidies?
-   Previous work
-   Relevant policy reform
-   Methods
-   Results & discussion

## Motivation

-   More than 35% of global fish stocks are being overfished
-   Subsidies that encourage overfishing are a key driver of overcapacity in the fishing industry
-   Subsidization is economic inefficiency

## Goals

-   Understanding how behavior changes in response to policy
-   Providing a reference for actions that decrease fishing effort

## What are fuel subsidies?

-   Capacity-enhancing subsidies that directly incentivize increased effort
-   Financial contributions awarded from the government on fuel that can partially determine profitability

## Why should we care?

-   Subsidies increase fishing effort, leading to over 60% of Mexican fishery stocks being at unsustainable levels
-   Many fisheries are not profitable without subsidies

## Previous Work

-   Revollo-Fernández et al. (2024) estimated economic and marginal product value to establish a direct relationship between subsidies and extraction
-   Sumaila et al. (2019) establishes the bulk of global subsidies to still be within the category of “capacity-enhancing” subsidies

## Relevant Policy Reform

![World Trade Organization Sustainable Development Goals](plots/sdg_txt.png)

## Impromptu Mexican subsidy reform

-   In 2020, Mexico eliminated fuel subsidies for the fishing sector
-   The vessels referenced in this study recieved an average of \$40,000 USD in subsidies annually prior to reform

## Objectives

-   Understanding how Mexico’s subsidy reform has caused a shift in effort, landings, or biomass
-   Focus: tuna longline fleet in the Gulf of Mexico,  heavily subsidized prior to 2020

# Data sources

## Subsidy data

-   CausaNautra provides subsidy allocations by economic unit from 2011-2019

## Vessel Montioring System

-   VMS data from the National Commission of Aquaculture and Fisheries (CONAPESCA)
-   provides vessel location and time
-   \~ 2,500 vessels
-   2007 - present

## Vessel-level landings

-   National commission of fisheries and aquaculture
-   target species and annual weight of live catch (kg)
-   2000-present

## Vessel status data

-   Mexican vessel registry including vessel characteristics, gear type, and home port

# Methods

## Focus Area

![Ramírez‑Mendoza et al.](plots/longline_sets.png)

## Data processing

-   VMS filtering
    -   26 longline vessels (81.3% of total fleet)
    -   2016-2024
    -   Depth \> 50m, Distance from shore \> 500m
-   Merged with subsidy and landings data
-   Calculated annual effort (hours) and catch-per-unit-effort (kg/hr) by vessel

## Data analysis

$$
y_{it} = \beta S_{it} + \omega_i + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

-   $y_{it}$: Outcome variable for vessel $i$ at year $t$
-   $\beta$: Effect of subsidy reform on outcome variable
-   $S_{it}$: Variable for subsidy status (0 = pre subsidy reform, 1 = post subsidy reform)
-   $\omega_i$: Fixed effect for vessel identification $i$
-   $\varepsilon_{it}$: Error term

## Data analysis

-   We used a linear regression model to analyze the differences in effort, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort before and after subsidy reform

-   This allows for an understanding of vessel-level differences in fishing behavior and productivity

: Impact of Subsidy Reform on effort, catch, and catch-per-unit-effort (cpue)

## Discussion

-   Fuel-subsidy removal can substantially curb fishing effort with marginal impacts on catch

-   First vessel-level estimates of the consequences of capacity-reducing reforms in the Gulf of Mexico tuna longline fishery

-   Long-term impacts of reforms require further investigation to ensure sustainable fisheries management

## Next steps

-   Compare patterns of behavior to an unsubsidized fleet as a control group
